# Saleae
This library provides a Rust API for the Saleae devices when running the Logic
program.

The API is based on the documentation provided here: [SaleaeSocketAPI](https://github.com/saleae/SaleaeSocketApi)

## Note
This library isn't complete, as there are more functions that need implementations.
